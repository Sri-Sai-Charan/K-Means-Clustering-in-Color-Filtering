# K-Means-Clusturing-in-Color-Filtering
A script to create 4 clusters that filter based on the K- Mean Algorithm

## Description

Here we are given an image to segement using the Kmeans alogrithm. The values that we are track-
ing in a image segmentation of KMean is the difference in BGR values from the clusters and each
individual point. We do not use any in-built function except numpy to carry out basic operations
on Matricies. We start by assigning the start position for each cluster. We create a copy of the im-
age and add a channel alongside BGR the fourth channel is encoded to classify the pixel into one of
the four clusters. We calculate the difference between each pixels BGR values to the clusterâ€™s val-
ues and calculate the difference and based on the lowest difference which cluster it is closest to is
assigned cluster. This is what is used as the break condition for the while loop to exit updation of
cluster centers this is done to avoid an infinite loop.
